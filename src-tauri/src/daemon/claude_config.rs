Never use done or waiting while your own subagents/background tasks are still running - that is working. Also: when a response involves 3 or more distinct tool-use steps, emit <cc-progress:N/M> on its own bare line in your text at the start of each step, where N is the current step (1-based) and M is your estimated total. Example: step 2 of 5 -> bare line containing only <cc-progress:2/5>. Skip this for short responses. Use exactly one style per marker and close it correctly: colon form closes with '>' like <cc-status:done>, XML form is <cc-status>done</cc-status>; never mix the two. When you take a screenshot or produce another visual result worth showing (a test run, a rendered page), surface it inline by reading it back with the Read tool rather than only describing it in prose.";

/// tool name + arguments together. So a non-git Bash call (the overwhelming
/// majority: edits, npm/cargo, ls, etc.) never spawns curl or reaches the
/// daemon at all. Anything starting with `git` still does (status, add, the
/// project's own `git -C <path> commit` form, ...) - `commit_lock::is_git_commit`
/// is the precise "is this actually `commit`" check once inside the daemon,
/// since `if`'s prefix matching alone can't safely narrow past the `-C <path>`

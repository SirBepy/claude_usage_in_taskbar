//! Consolidated SQLite store for usage snapshots, token records, and skill
//! events. Self-contained module; not yet wired into `AppState`, the
//! scheduler, or IPC (that lands in a later slice).
//!
//! All three datasets share one shape (`id`, unix-second `timestamp`, JSON
//! `data` blob), which makes retention a single query per table and lets the
//! existing Rust structs persist unchanged via serde.

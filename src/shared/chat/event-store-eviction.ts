// Idle-eviction / TTL lifecycle policy for the session event cache. Split out
// from event-store.ts's core dedup/cache job (ai_todo 196) - the perf pass
// that introduced this (2026-07-09, commits c208e471/a3065785) layered a
// distinct concern onto the store, so it now composes an EvictionPolicy
// instance instead of owning the timer/teardown logic itself. See
// event-store.ts's file header and CacheEntry for the full entry shape and
// the "why" behind lastAccess/ended semantics.

// Eviction (ai_todo perf fix): a session ever opened stays cached forever
// (see event-store.ts's file header) unless reclaimed. An entry is eligible
// once it has both (a) no subscribers - nothing is currently rendering it in
// a pane, on this window/webview - and (b) gone idle for IDLE_TTL_MS. "Idle"
// is driven by lastAccess, which every genuine read/render touches AND every
// accepted live event (deliver()) refreshes - so a background session with an
// active turn (tool calls, streaming chunks, anything) keeps pushing
// lastAccess forward and never goes idle long enough to be swept mid-turn.
// Reopening after eviction is safe: loadInitial/subscribe rebuild a fresh
// entry and re-fetch from disk via load_history_page, same as a session
// touched for the first time.
